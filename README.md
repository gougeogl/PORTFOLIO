# A Brief Game Documentation
## A Nap in Time: 
### A History Major's Unexpected Journey

## Theme
A History major gets trapped in a dream state after falling asleep in lecture.
There are four major time periods to explore, including the early French Revolution,
Occupied France during World War II, Charles Lindberghs' solo flight to Paris, and
the indictment of Al Capone for tax evasion during Prohibition.

## Style
This is a single-player command line game. Structurally it is an escape room.
Unique missions, and the accumulation of specific items let the player escape from
the dream state, and win the game. There are four ways to win, and 13 to lose. 
Every round allows for searching, dropping, and retrieving items throughout the ten
levels. Eating, navigation, and most importantly missions, aid the user in winning
the game. There are 100 rounds of choices before the player dies.
